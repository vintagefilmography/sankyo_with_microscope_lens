This project is based on a Sankyo 1000 projector and small ELP global shutter camera.  
Parts:  
Sankyo1000 projector  
Camera:  
ELP-USBGS1200P01-MFV  
It has 1920x1080 resolution and it is capable of real time transfer.  
Light:  
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098W63FJ5  
LED light with the diffuser for even light distribution over the entire frame.  
Lens:

## Setting up  
Plug the LED lights into computer USB to charge them up since they were only partially charged before shipping.  
Note: the charging cable has a magnetic connector that engages with the LED charging port.
Set the projector on a flat surface.  
Remove the projector lens by pulling put on the focus control and slide the lens out.  
Attach the lens to the camera.  
Align the camera with the projector. The calmera lens front distance should be 2" - 3" away meacured from the   
projector lens mount front.  
Plug the projector in.   
Plug the camera into the computer USB port. Turn off all running apps and disconnect from WIFI.  
Feed the film in. 
Turn the LED light by holding the side button. Another press will increase brightness.  
If you continue pressing the button, the unit will cycle through several brightness levels.  
Leave it at the lowest.  
Holding the button will turn the light off.  
Install the light in the place where the old light goes. It should fit in with the bottom in the socket hole  
and the housing fitting into the heat shield recess.  
Run amcap.exe frim release folder provided here, and turn the preview on as per the instructions below.  
Note, you may need to advance the film a bit to making sure that the shutter is not coverineg the light.  
The film frame should be displayed on the computer screen. Adjust the frame size by adjusting the camera distance.  
Adjut focus using the focus ring on the lens.  This process is a bit tricky and takes a while going back and fort.  
If the frame is tilted , adjust it by placing shims under the projector feet or rotating the camera if the stand has that capability.    
Now you are reeady to run the capture. Follow the instructions below.

## Operating Instructions  
Download Release folder as a zip file by clicking on the Code button from the top of this page.   
Download into your locala work directory.  
Unzip it there.  
Go to the release dir and double click on AmCap.exe   
The main window will open.

Select Camera Control tab. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/426ed035-6ade-402f-abab-6f343c46cdec)  
Here you can change to auto or manual exposure.  
Manual exposure is recommended.

It is to be noted that this screen can be envoked at any time during capture by pressing up arrow on the keyboard.  
This allows for dynamic exposure change at any time during capture.  
Set output frame rate to 8.

Adjust focus by sliding the camera in and out of the projector lens mount barrel.  
Pull out on the focus adjust knob to release the tension on the camera mount.  
This will make the adjustment easier to do.

Adjust the projector height by turning the projector height adjustment screw in and out to center the frame height in the   
capture window. The projector height when adjustedd properly will make the projector weight push down onto the camera bottom post  
so that the captured frame is right in the center of the capture window.

The capture process will start.
Adjust the speed by turning the speed d knob past the midd point roughly pointing to the center of the "FAST" label.
If there is some flicker present then turn the speed up or down slightly until you get zero flicker.  
Note that it some cases the flicker cannot be completely eliminated if the exposure is set too low.  
In that case hit the Up arrow key and in the camera tab tweak the exposure higher and readjust the speed.  
A fast way of changing the exposure can be achieved by clicking onto the exposure slider.  
The slider will bee highlighted. Now just use the left and right arrow keys.  
Once done  with the  film, click OK on the exposure window.  
The window will close.  
Stop the capture by clicking on the stop  pulldown.

Turn the projector and light off.  
Now you can precede with output video edit.  
The video can be viewed as is, but some post processing could make the viewing
experience more pleasant.
Here are a few recommendations:
-  Flip the video horizontally.
-  Crop
-  Frame interpolation will make panning much smoother.

## Postproceessing
Avisynth can be used for some postporcessig.  Get Avisynth from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/avisynth2/
For help with Avisynth refer to:  
http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Main_Page  
Avisynth does not run as a standalone application. It is a tool that allows video editors and viewers to run the script.
The script is essentially a text file that contains avisynth commands for video processing.
One video tool that is very handy for video processing is called VirtualDub.
In addition to basic video processing, VirtialDub reads the avisynth script as well.
Download VirtualDub from here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/vdfiltermod/files/  
A few useful scripts will be added here in the neext rev of this doc.

## Projector Mods
The projector lamp was replaced with the LED light. 
A custom mount was added so that the light fits nicely in the lamp compartment. 
A custom comact camera was used with a custom mount adapter.
